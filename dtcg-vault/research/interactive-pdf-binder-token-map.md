# Interactive PDF Binder Navigation — token consolidation rationale

Values in this component were extracted directly from `tool-pdf-interactive.py`'s own
Python constants (the authoritative source), not from the design draft's prose
description — one real discrepancy was found this way: the draft's color table lists a
7th token `GREY_MID` (`#666680`, described as "inactive entry subtitles"), but no
subtitle rows exist anywhere in the actual generator code. Dropped from this component's
token set rather than silently carried forward as a phantom value.

## Why this is a separate rendering context, not folded into paper.primitive.page.*

Every other Paper component in this consolidation is a CSS `@page`-based WeasyPrint
document. This component is generated directly in PDF point-space via `reportlab` +
`pypdf` — same physical units (points), genuinely different coordinate system (origin
bottom-left, not top-left; no `@page` box model). Kept as its own
`paper.primitive.pdf-nav.*` group rather than forced to share the CSS-print page
primitives, since the two are not interchangeable despite both using `pt`.

## Tool location and portability

The canonical template lives at
`project-jennifer/tool-pdf-interactive/tool-pdf-interactive.py` (258 lines) with
`README.md`/`README.es.md`. Seven filled-in production copies exist under
`project-jennifer/inputs/*/` for real Bencal/Agency/MOU/Mexico-Prospectus binders —
those remain business-admin artifacts and do not move. The canonical template itself is
self-contained (only `pypdf`/`reportlab` dependencies, no project-jennifer-specific
paths or business content) and ports to `pointsav-monorepo/tool-pdf-interactive/` with
low rework — the main generalizing step is lifting its top-of-file `CONFIG` block into
CLI arguments or a manifest file, so one installed tool can build any binder without
editing source.

A second, more-developed copy of this tool (676 lines, including a `find_home_anchor`
feature via `pdfplumber`) already exists committed directly at
`pointsav-monorepo`'s repository root — a real, pre-existing `repo-layout.md` violation
(no scripts allowed at repo root) predating this consolidation. That copy, not the
project-jennifer template, is the better base for the actual `tool-*` port (Step 6a of
this initiative), since it is already more feature-complete and already properly
licensed/committed within the monorepo; the project-jennifer template's design values
were used for this token consolidation since it is the cleaner, generalized reference
the design draft actually describes.
