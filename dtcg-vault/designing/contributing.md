# Contributing

This substrate is built to receive real proposals from other product clusters, not
just from the team that maintains it directly. The process below isn't a hypothetical
— it's the exact path a real contribution took, from a domain-specific product build to
eight components now documented in the [component library](/components/chip-row/usage/).

## Two ways in

**You're building something domain-specific and think part of it is generic.** This is
the common path — a product team (GIS, BIM, the wiki engine, or a future cluster) builds
UI for its own domain, notices a pattern that isn't domain-specific at all, and proposes
it for the shared substrate. The worked example below follows this path exactly.

**You want to change an existing token or component.** Open an issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/pointsav/pointsav-design-system) with the label `design`,
including a screenshot and the affected component or token name. Token changes
specifically require a `master_cosign` before they land — see the note on that below.

## The process, worked from a real example

In April–May 2026, the BIM product cluster (`project-bim`) was mid-build on its own
AEC-domain UI and had assembled nine component patterns along the way. Some were
genuinely BIM-specific — a 3D viewport, a spatial tree browser, an IFC properties panel.
Others weren't domain-specific at all: a copy-to-clipboard code block, a semantic chip
row, a categorised sidebar. The cluster proposed the second group back to this substrate.

**Step 1 — draft, don't just paste code.** The proposal wasn't a pull request of raw
markup. It was a `DESIGN-RESEARCH` draft — `design-generic-components-index.md` — naming
each candidate component, its structural shape, and one genuinely open question: should
the generic versions inherit BIM's own `.bim-*` class-naming convention, or use this
substrate's existing `ps-*` prefix?

**Step 2 — stage it, addressed to this cluster.** The draft was staged to project-bim's
own `drafts-outbound/` and routed here via the design draft pipeline — the same passive
outbox mechanism this workspace uses for every cross-cluster editorial handoff. Nothing
moved until a session here picked it up.

**Step 3 — review resolves naming, scope, and licensing — explicitly, in writing.** This
is the part worth reading closely, because the reasoning is what makes a review real
rather than rubber-stamped:

- *Naming*: `ps-*` won, not `.bim-*` — because a tenant surface that consumes both
  BIM-specific and generic components needs a coherent vocabulary. BIM's own cluster-
  internal classes stay `.bim-*` on `cluster/project-bim`; only the generic forms
  crossing into this substrate take the `ps-*` prefix.
- *Scope — what actually crossed over*: eight of the nine proposed patterns were accepted
  as generic stubs (`chip-row`, `code-block-with-copy`, `edit-on-github-link`,
  `empty-state-card`, `machine-surface-footer`, `preview-frame`, `sidebar-accordion`,
  `tab-bar-disclosure` — the same eight now fully documented in this library). The ninth,
  a breadcrumb pattern, was **not** added — this substrate already shipped an equivalent
  `breadcrumb` component, so the review pointed the originating cluster at reusing it
  instead of forking a near-duplicate. Seven further patterns (a 3D viewport, spatial
  tree, properties panel, and four more AEC-specific components) were explicitly
  **excluded** as too domain-specific for a generic substrate — they stayed in
  `pointsav-design-system/components/bim-*/` on the BIM cluster's own branch.
- *Licensing, forwarded rather than decided unilaterally*: the same review cycle surfaced
  that one BIM-specific component (a 3D viewport built on an AGPL-3.0-licensed rendering
  library) changes the licensing posture of the app that ships it. This substrate doesn't
  make BCSC or licensing calls on another cluster's behalf — the finding was written down
  and forwarded for governance review rather than acted on locally.

**Step 4 — acceptance is a committed, git-tracked decision record**, not a verbal
agreement. Two research files carry the full reasoning: one records the structural
acceptance (path conventions, token taxonomy, what's in vs. out), the other records the
component flowback itself (naming resolution, the accepted/rejected list, and what each
stub still needs before it's a complete recipe). Both live in `research/` in this vault,
readable by anyone — human or AI agent — deciding whether to build on this pattern.

**Step 5 — a stub becomes a real component over time, not all at once.** Landing as a
`recipe.json` stub is the start, not the finish. Each of those eight components needed a
follow-up pass — `usage.md`, `style.md`, `code.md`, `accessibility.md` — written against
the stub's actual structure, honestly noting where the recipe still falls short of its
name (one of the eight is still a static list, not a true accordion, and says so on its
own usage page rather than pretending otherwise).

## What this means if you're proposing something

- Write down *why* a pattern is generic, not just that it exists — the review needs a
  reason to say yes, and a reason to say no to the parts that should stay domain-specific.
- Expect naming and scope questions to get resolved in writing, with a stated rationale —
  not silently deferred and not decided by whoever writes the most code first.
- If your proposal touches licensing (a dependency with a viral license, a token that
  crosses a compliance boundary), say so explicitly rather than letting it surface later.
- A stub is an honest starting point. Don't promise complete behavior in a component's own
  docs that the recipe doesn't actually implement yet.

## Token changes need a co-sign

Any change to `tokens/dtcg-bundle.json` or a token file requires `master_cosign` in the
proposing draft's frontmatter before it can be committed here — this is a harder gate than
component proposals, since a token change can silently shift color, spacing, or type
across every consuming surface at once.
